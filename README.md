# Game Project

Welcome to the readme for my first project at General Assembly. 

## Brief

To build a classic arcade game in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Canvas is not allowed!

We were given the following options:
- Battleships
- Connect 4
- Minesweeper
- Pacman
- Reversi
- Snake
- Tetris
- Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
- Frogger
- Space Invaders

I choose Connect 4, purely for nostalgia reasons! 

## About Connect 4

Connect 4 is a game where players attempt to make a line of four pieces in a 7 x 6 grid. Players can drop their pieces into columns, so that their piece rests in the lowest available space in that column.

The winner is the first to create a line of four in any direction, including diagonally. If the board is filled before a line of 4 can be made, the game is declared a draw.

## Game Requirements

* The game should be playable for two players on the same computer, taking turns to make their moves
* The winner should be displayed when the game is over

## Future enhancements

* Responsive design
* Single player mode with the computer making reasonable moves
